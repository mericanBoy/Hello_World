# Hello_World

<p> Hello, my name is mericanBoy and after poking around at home on my PC I decided I wanted to get to know my hardware better. So I went to CodeCademy.com and got a small unserstanding of HTML and CSS, I am now attempting to become fluent with JavaScript as my first language. If you have any knowledge or are a secret billionaire reading this at home, go ahead and leave a comment on this page! (P.S. If you are a billionare and have like $1,000 USD available, I could totally buy better tech.) </p>
